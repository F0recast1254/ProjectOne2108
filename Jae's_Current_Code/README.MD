Issues: 
//instead of sort() use sortedInsert() when reading from the txt file
//fix sortedInsert() for mulitple same priority and while the priority is the same check the
// arrivalTime until false
//example :
//issue 100 102 101 , 102 is inserted

All the menu functions should work,if there's any issues let me know or if I should change something.
